Chitchat is a chat application where users can **send messages in real-time** with each other through private rooms.

## Built With

**Front-end**:
* HTML, CSS, React

**Back-end**:
* Javascript (NodeJS, Express)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

I used the [concurrently package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run both front-end and back-end at the same time in development.

## Live Demo
The application's *back-end* is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), while the *front-end* is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
